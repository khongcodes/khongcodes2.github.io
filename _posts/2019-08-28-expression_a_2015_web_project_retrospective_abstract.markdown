I grew up with HTML and CSS in my backdrop, as another language I could always have the opportunity to turn to. Hardly a unique rait among those in my age group - myspace and neopets profile customization, temporally transposing into tumblr page styling, carried us through adolescence. I remember painstakingly transposing sheet music into Music Macro Language (MML) to get my Mabinogi character to poorly perform Bleach's opening Asterisk on the lute, and coming back afterwards to try to translate every anime opening I could remember into the required code. It was a kind of magic to me, inherently a form of creative expression.

In 2015, I had an idea for a web project. I loved fantasy role-playing games, especially ones that broke traditional genre boundaries. I had recently re-played Final Fantasy Tactics, and felt inspired by the importance the system had placed on each units' training and vocational history. You may be a white-magic healer now, but so what? Yesterday you were a potion-slinging chemist, and tomorrow you'll be a space-bending time mage. There was a lack of clean-ness there that I felt inspired by, that made the membrane between the mundane and the fantastical begin to blur. I wanted to make the lines drawn messier. I wanted to make something that felt magical, something that would be different today than it was tomorrow.

I didn't know very much HTML and CSS. I had never done anything with Javascript. But I remember doing a lot of googling, and scraped together [this webpage](https://khongcodes.github.io/Dual/) in a couple days (hit refresh a coupe times). It isn't much to look at now. But I won't let myself forget the feelings I had when I made this, and the unquestioning conviction that coding was as much a tool for creative expression as anything else.
