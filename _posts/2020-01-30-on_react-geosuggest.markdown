For my [React Redux project](https://github.com/khongcodes2/Invitation), I imported a component - [react-geosuggest](https://github.com/ubilabs/react-geosuggest).

Working with it helped me to get my feet wet with Google Maps API. It offers a lot of possibilities for an API - I didn't have time before my deadline to do more than dip my toe into it with the beginner friendly [Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/start), but with the full API, and a little more dedicated time for tinkering, it's apparent it can be a [really handy tool for visualizing data](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/earthquakes). Google Maps Embed API helped me meet my personal bare minimum goals for this project, but it's the shortcoming that bothers me the most about it. I look forward to spending more time working the project out.
