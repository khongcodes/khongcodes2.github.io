This blog post relates to a project whose repo can be found [here](https://github.com/khongcodes2/SaleTracker).

This project was fun to work on - it's satisfying making something with navigable pages! It almost feels like building a space to walk through; a simple virtual architecture. I couldn't help but try to get really into the weeds on this, spending a lot of time trying to gain understanding of CSS, particularly grid layout. That's something I really want to improve at - I didn't even have time to work on resources on responsive design, but I'm itching to dig into it.

This weekend I will be tabling for PEOW studio at Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo (MICE), so I wanted to make a simple point-of-sale service to keep track of my sales and stock. I wasn't able to make a responsive cart-sum-tabulator by way of calculator because I didn't have the scripting know-how, but I feel satisfied that my page layout is clean and readable, given my hasty refresh on grid layout. Also building mechanisms to authenticate user credentials and input types, in addition to the data-storing and login stuff felt cool.

I'm chomping at the bit to get my hands dirty with CSS even more.
